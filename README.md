## Data Overview

### Data Sourcing

The source of this data is external. It is taken from the box scores of each game played from the seasons 1963 - 2022. Due to the data being from the games itself and its box score recording, I would consider this data trustworthy

### Data Collection

This data was collected throughout each player’s NBA career. This includes information on the player itself as well as their overview box score throughout each season. This data was collected and documented by the NBA.

### Data Collection
● On a player level, the data contains personal information about them such as height, weight, country of origin, what college they attended, and when they got drafted.

● On a player's career level, the data contains information for each season on how many points, rebounds, assists, net rating, offensive and defensive rebounding percentage, and other percentages of their shots and assists.

### Data Limitations

● The first limitation to note is that the 3 point line was introduced in the 1979-80 season, meaning point averages will increase after that point forward.

● The second limitation is that two of the best NBA players, Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell, both had extensive careers and statistics that were not recorded during part of their career, so those outliers will be considered in future analysis

● In 2001, a rule was established that limited a player from being inside the “key” zone for more than 3 seconds without guarding an opposing player, this may skew data that prevented bigger players from making as many points

● In the Kaggle site, the author noted that 52 rows were missing data, but were filled in through https://www.basketball-reference.com/ , a trusted site with player stats for each season.
Another limitation is how the data was collected back then before modern technology, there could be room for a potential misinput if player’s scores and statistics.
